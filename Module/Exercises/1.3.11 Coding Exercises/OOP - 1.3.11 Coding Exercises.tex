\section*{Coding Exercises}

Instructions: Write a program that solves the following problems.
Submit your code to the Google Drive folder provided by the instructor.

% Red Large Text
\textcolor{red}{\Large{Note 1: You have to answer 2 out of the 4 exercises.}}

% Answer 1 and one of the remaining exercises
\textcolor{red}{\Large{Note 2: You have to answer Exercise 1 and one of the
remaining exercises. (e.g., Exercise 1 and Exercise 2, Exercise 1 and Exercise
3, etc.)}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
  \item Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle given the base
  and height and prints the result to the console.
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
      \coordinate [label=left:$A$] (A) at (-2cm,-1.cm);
      \coordinate [label=right:$C$] (C) at (2.2cm,-1.0cm);
      \coordinate [label=above:$B$] (B) at (1cm,1.0cm);
      \draw (A) -- node[sloped,above] {c} (B) -- node[sloped,above,] {a} (C) -- node[below] {b = 8} (A);
      \draw[dashed] (B) -- node[left] {h = 4} (A-|B);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align}
    b &= 8 \text{, the base of the triangle} \\
    h &= 4 \text{, the height of the triangle} \\
    A &= \frac{b \cdot h}{2} \text{, formula for the area of a triangle}
  \end{align}
  \item Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given the
  length and width and prints the result to the console.
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
      \coordinate [label=left:$A$] (A) at (-2cm,1cm);
      \coordinate [label=right:$B$] (B) at (2cm,1cm);
      \coordinate [label=right:$C$] (C) at (2cm,-1cm);
      \coordinate [label=left:$D$] (D) at (-2cm,-1cm);
      \draw (A) -- node[above] {w = 4} (B) -- node[right] {l = 2} (C) -- (D) -- (A);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align}
    l &= 2 \text{, the length of the rectangle} \\
    w &= 4 \text{, the width of the rectangle} \\
    A &= l \cdot w \text{, formula for the area of a rectangle}
  \end{align}
  \item Write a program that calculates the area of a circle given the radius
    and prints the result to the console.
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
      \draw (2,2) circle (2cm);
      \draw[fill=black](2,2) circle (2 pt) node [above] {O};
      \draw[](2,2) -- (4,2) node [midway,above] {$\scriptstyle r = 4.0$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align}
    r &= 4.0 \text{, the radius of the circle} \\
    \pi &= 3.141592653589793 \text{, the mathematical constant pi} \\
    A &= \pi \cdot r^2 \text{, formula for the area of a circle}
  \end{align}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission of Coding Exercises}

Instructions:
